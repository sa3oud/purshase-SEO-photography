                    <h2>Why Local SEO Is Your Biggest Lead Generator</h2>
                    <p>For photographers, traffic doesn't matter if it's not **local**. A wedding photographer in Seattle doesn't need clicks from Miami. Your most valuable searches (e.g., "wedding photographer near me") start and end with Google's **Local Map Pack** results. Optimizing your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the single fastest way to get your business in front of ready-to-book local clients.</p>

                <section class="key-steps">
                    <h2>Step 1: The Foundation — Claim, Verify, and Categorize</h2>
                    <p>First, ensure your profile is claimed and verified. Your **Primary Category** must be accurate (e.g., 'Wedding Photographer'). Do not try to stuff keywords here.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The NAP Consistency Check</h3>
                    <p>Verify that your **N**ame, **A**ddress, and **P**hone number are *identical* across your website, GBP, and all major online directories (Yelp, The Knot, etc.). Inconsistencies hurt your local ranking authority.</p>

                    <h2>Step 2: Optimization Strategies That Actually Rank</h2>
                    
                    <h3>A. Service Area, Not Just Address</h3>
                    <p>Set your service areas (e.g., all surrounding towns) if you travel to clients. If you work from home, you can hide your physical address while still targeting a wide service radius.</p>

                    <h3>B. Photo Upload Strategy (The Portfolio Feed)</h3>
                    <p>You must upload new, high-quality photos weekly. **Crucially:** use geotagged photos or add captions with relevant local keywords ("Downtown [City] family portraits"). The GBP profile acts like a ranking social media feed—feed it!</p>
                    
                    <h3>C. The Reviews Factor (Conversion Signal)</h3>
                    <p>Respond to **every** review—good or bad—professionally and promptly. This increases user engagement, which is a significant signal to Google. Always include the keyword and location when responding (e.g., "Thank you for the wonderful review about your **Richmond wedding photography** experience!").</p>
